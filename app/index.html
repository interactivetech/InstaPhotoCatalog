<!--ng-app attribute represents an Angular directive named ngApp (Angular uses spinal-case for its custom attributes 
...and camelCase for the corresponding directives which implement them -->

<!--ngApp is used to flag the html element that Angular should consider to be the root element of our application-->

<!-- When page loads, Angular looks for the ngApp directive. 
If Angular finds the directive, it will bootstrap the application with...
...the root of the application DOM being the element on which the ngApp directive was defined.

 -> This gives application developers the freedom to tell Angular if the entire html page or only a portion of it should be treated as the Angular application-->
 
 
 <!-- Note on ngApp: will bootstrap angularjs apps automatically, 
 
 3 important things that happens during app bootstrap:
 
 	1)  The injector(used to retrieve object instances) that will be used for dependency injection is created
	 2)  injector will then create the root scope that will become the context for the model of our application.
	 3) Angular will then "compile" the DOM starting at the ngApp root element
	 	- processing any directives and bindings found along the way. -->

	<!-- snippet is an Angular expressin (anything inside {{}} and ) displays two core features of Angular templating capabilities:
	
	1) binding, denotd by curly brackets {{}}
	2) an expressing, used in binding-->
	
	<!-- Binding tells angular it should eval an expression and insert result into DOM in place of binding
	* Binding will result in efficient continuous updates whenever the result of the expression evaluation changes-->
