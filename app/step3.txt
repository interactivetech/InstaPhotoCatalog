Goal: add full text search
     end-to-end text, stayig with the app, keeps an eye on iy, and quickly detects regressions

     - with the <input> tag: angular will bind the name of the input box (query)
       to a variable of the name name in the data model and keeps the two in sync

     - the data that the user types into the input box is immediately available as a filter input in the list repeater
     (... filter: query), when changes to the data model cause the repeater's input to change, the repeater effeciently
     updates the DOM to reflect the current state of the model

     filter function uses the query to create a new array that contains only those records that match the query
     value to create a new array that contains only those records that match the query

     ngRepeat automatically updates the view in response to the charging numbers of phones returned by the "filter" filter
     The process is completely transparent to the developer
